== 5. Repositories

=== 5.1 Example Service Broker


*evoila/cf-service-broker-example*

https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-example

An empty Cloud Foundry Service Broker missing concrete implementation of a distinct service. Supports deployment to OpenStack and Docker. Uses Redis Database for management. Configuration files and deployment scripts must be added. Concrete Service logic and binding logic has to be added.


=== 5.2 Deployment, Infrastructure, etc.

*evoila/cf-service-broker-core*

https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-core

This project provides core functionalities for Cloud Foundry Service Broker. It needs deployment services and a persistence service (see https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-deployment and https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-persistence) as well as a concrete implementation of service binding routines for a concrete service (for examples see https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-example and https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-elasticsearch).

Everything *blue* in the following picture is part of the core project:

*evoila/cf-service-broker-persistence*

https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-persistence

Implements the cf-service-broker (see https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker) persistence interface with services using Redis. So the management data and inner status of the service broker can be kept in a Redis database.

*evoila/cf-service-broker-deployment*

https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-deployment

This project provides support for deployment of service instances via Cloud Foundry Service Broker (see https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker) as Docker Containers onto a Docker Swarm cluster or as Virtual Machines onto OpenStack via Heat Scripts
