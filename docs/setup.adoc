== Setup

=== Installation and Configuration Scripts

==== Type of Scripts
scripts for automatic installation and configuration of different services for databases, logging and queueing

Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, Logstash and Monit

Difference between Openstack (or other full Virtual Machine provider e.g. VMware etc.) and containerized on Docker

include::snippets/setup/install-separation.adoc[]

==== Parametrization

For most services you can give parameters to the scripts for setting user, password and number of databases (or vhost)
parameters


==== Modularity

All scripts for the Installation of the services are modularized and subdivided in 5 modules. This is important for an easier mantainability, further development and enhancements


===== Module 1: Start Script

the first skript is the start skript is only to set some very basic things like the path to the repositorys, loading and execution of the central template.

TIP: you can use this script as a standalone script or embed in own code +
additional this is the place for handing over the parameters to the set of scripts

tasks of Start Script:

specifing of used repositories (mainrepository and script specific subrepositorie)

loading the Central Template

place were you can embed your parameters for the central template


===== Module 2: Central Template `[servicename]-template.sh`

definition of variables

.Variables defined in `[servicename]-template.sh`
[format="csv",width="80%",cols="3"]
[frame="topbot",grid="none"]
|======
Version of application,*,Version of the installed application
configuration Path,*,
datadirectory,*,Variable for the data directory (in the scripts set to `/data/` )
check path,$CHECK_PATH,Path used for the scripts to check if it is a new installation or is the service still installed
startcommand Openstack,$OPENSTACK_START,Command to start service on Openstack as environment
stopcommand Openstack,$OPENSTACK_STOP,Command to stop service on Openstack as environment
startcommand Docker,$DOCKER_START,Command to start service on Docker as environment
stopcammand Docker,$DOCKER_STOP,Command to stop service on Docker as environment
other service specific Variables,for parameters send from start script, for the environment
|======

*different for each service

accepts parameters from the start script or the snippet of the start script you embeded in your code

Central Template for "control" of all following steps

loads and executes the child scripts in the nessasary order

finaly it loads the

the name sheme of the central template is always [servicename]-template.sh

loading service specific "monit controll file" `[servicename]-monitrc` for later configuration of monit


===== Module 3: Installation

Installation of service

.prepairs environment for installation
- creates groups on the host

- creates user for the service on the host

- creates home directoies for the user

- sets write/read permissions and ownership for created folders if needed

the name sheme of the central template is always [servicename]-template.sh



===== Module 4: Configuration

Configuration of the service

applying of databases

generating the administrative user of the service

configuring password for this user

the name sheme of the central template is always [servicename]-template.sh

===== Module 5: Run

starts the ready configurated service

the name sheme of the central template is always [servicename]-template.sh

===== Module 6: Monit

for monitoring and service recovery

the names of the central monit template is monit-template.sh

=== Platform specific

we developt our scripts for running on different platforms

most code is similar for both of the used platforms

.Distinctions between openstack and docker
[NOTE]
subtile distinctions between openstack and docker embeded direct in the code to realize a easier mantainability and further development and enhancements

==== Openstack

==== Docker

=== Service Specific

==== Postgres

==== Redis

==== MongoDB

==== MySQL

==== RabbitMQ

==== Elasticsearch

==== Logstash

==== Monit

==== Ruby

=== Central Logging

In a next step a central logging for the services will be added.
