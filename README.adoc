=== What are Service Brokers?

A Service Broker provides the possibility to extend a platform (in our case it's link:https://www.cloudfoundry.org/[Cloud Foundry]) with services (for example a database) that can be consumed by applications deployed to this platform.

It comes with a catalog of services and service plans, provides service instances, and contains connection details and credentials. It also interprets calls for creating and deleting service instances (for example single databases, dedicated clusters, or just an account on a web application), which means to reserve resources on a serivce, as well as calls for binding and unbinding services, which means to deliver information to an application for accessing the resource.
